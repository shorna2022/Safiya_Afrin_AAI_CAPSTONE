# Semantic Analysis Project

## Overview
This project harnesses Natural Language Processing (NLP) to develop a sentiment analysis system, designed to analyze customer feedback and classify it into negative, positive, and neutral sentiments. This system offers an in-depth understanding of customer perceptions, crucial for improving customer experiences and business strategies.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Automated classification of customer feedback into distinct sentiment categories.
- **Data Insights**: Gaining actionable insights from customer feedback to enhance product and service quality.
- **Advanced NLP Techniques**: Utilization of various NLP models and approaches for robust analysis.

## Data Source
The dataset is sourced from Kaggle's "Twitter Entity Sentiment Analysis". It includes:
- `twitter_training.csv`
- `twitter_validation.csv`
